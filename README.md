Non-Deepfake Attacks on Face Recognition 🤖

Face recognition technology has become increasingly widespread in various applications, from security systems 🛡️ to personalized experiences 👥. However, as this technology advances, so do the techniques for bypassing it. Some common non-deepfake attacks include:

1. SQL Injection 💻🔐
SQL injection is a common method of bypassing face recognition systems when the technology is linked to a backend database. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the SQL queries, attackers can manipulate the database and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including face recognition data. This type of attack primarily targets the system’s database rather than the face recognition software itself.

2. Spoofing with Photos 📸🖼️
A simple and effective method of spoofing face recognition systems is by using photographs of the authorized user. Attackers can print out a photo, or even use a high-quality digital image, to deceive the system into thinking they are the legitimate person. This attack exploits the system’s reliance on 2D images without considering the depth or the liveliness of the face.

3. Masking and 3D Masks 🎭😷
More advanced spoofing techniques involve the use of masks, including 3D-printed masks that mimic the target’s facial features. These masks are highly realistic and can be worn to fool face recognition systems, especially if the system is not equipped to detect depth or other distinguishing features like eye movement or facial expressions. With the rise of 3D printing technology, these masks have become more accessible and harder to detect by conventional face recognition systems.


4...3D Model Attacks 🖥️: Crafting 3D models of a person’s face and using them to bypass recognition systems.

5.....Makeup or Obstruction 💄😷: Using makeup or face coverings to obscure certain facial features.

6.............Infrared Attacks 🌡️: Using infrared images to bypass the facial recognition system by targeting the different light spectrum.
    
      
      7.System Vulnerabilities (CVEs, OSVDBs)
Face recognition systems often run on complex operating systems. If these systems are not regularly patched, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities 🕳️ — listed in CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and OSVDBs (Open Sourced Vulnerability Database). For example, an outdated library or insecure root permission configuration can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation 
  Face recognition often runs on embedded or general-purpose OSes (like Linux or Windows) 🖥️. Attackers may exploit known vulnerabilities  
     Install rootkits 🧬 for persistent backdoors

Hijack camera feeds or facial databases 🎥📁

These attacks exploit system-level flaws, often not directly related to the recognition algorithm itself.

8... Time Zone Advance Attack ⏰🌍
This is a lesser-known but clever attack where an attacker manipulates the system’s internal & physics clock or timezone settings to replay or pre-approve access based on timing data. By tricking the system’s time validation, unauthorized access can be granted without needing to spoof the face itself.
